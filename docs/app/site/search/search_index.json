The Algorithm is implemented for 3D Side-By-Side VR Videos. Some parameter are currently hard coded. It should be possible to expand the functionality to 2D Videos by changing the code, with the following limitations. Limitations Static camera setup Fixed reference point of relative movement in video required No video cuts within a tracking sequence allowed No change of position of the performers Features in the video which are visible in all following frames of the tracking sequence required. Process Selection of the features for the Woman and Men in the video, which should be tracked. Predict the feature positions in the following video frames by OpenCV Tracker. Calculate the difference between the predicted tracking boxes. Map the relative difference to an absolute difference score by user input. Filter all local min and max points to get the final action positions for the Funscript. Improvements You can change the OpenCV tracker in the source code which predicts the position. OpenCV offers several trackers which differ in prediction accuracy and processing speed. See also OpenCV Tracker . You can set the number of frames that are interpolated by the skip_frames parameter. 0 means that the OpenCV tracker delivers a prediction for each frame. This is slower but more accurate. Or if greater than zero, the individual frames are skipped and then the tracking boxes are interpolated, which increases the processing speed but decreases the accuracy. I have set the value to 1, i.e. every 2nd frame is skipped and interpolated. Which provides a good mix of accuracy and speed. It is recommended to use a low resolution video e.g. 4K for generating the funscript actions, as the processing speed is higher.","title":"Python Funscript Editor"},{"location":"#python-funscript-editor","text":"A Python program to quickly create prototype algorithms to partially automate the generation of funscripts.
