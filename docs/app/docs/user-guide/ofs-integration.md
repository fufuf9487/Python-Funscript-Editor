# Open Funscripter Integration

## Installation Windows Option 1 (Easy)

If you use an older version (`v0.0.x`), i recommend to first delete the `funscript_generator_windows.lua` script in `C:\Program Files\OpenFunscripter\data\lua`.

1. Download OFS from https://github.com/OpenFunscripter/OFS/releases. **(min required OFS Version 1.4.2!)**
   <br> ![OFS Download](./images/ofs_installation_01.jpg)
2. Install OFS

3. Start OFS at least once and close it again.

4. Download the MTFG OFS Extension Installer from https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/Python-Funscript-Editor/releases.

5. Execute the downloaded executable. Wait for the installation to complete.

6. Open OFS, activate the extension (3) and enable the window (4). Now you can use the extension at any position in the Video with the _Start MTFG_ Button (5). On slow computers, the program may take several seconds to start!. Before you press the _Start MTFG_ Button you have to open a video in OFS else you get only the Message Box "Video file was not specified!".

7. **Optional**: Add global key binding for the extension in OFS.

8. **Troubleshot**: If you have any problems that can not be solved with the Troubleshot section below please post an screenshot of the following log output window after you have try to run the Generator at least once:

NOTE: I have removed Installation Option 2 du to problems with data transfer to OFS. You should switch to Install Option 1!

## Troubleshot for all Installation Options

### When calling the generator, only a message box is displayed with the message: "Video file was not specified!"

In some cases OFS does not set the path to the video file within the lua script correctly (the variable `VideoFilePath` is empty). This happen when the video path contains some special character like square braked `[` and `]`. **Rename your video files and store them in a path without special character**. Then the variable should be set by OFS and the motion tracking funscript generator should work.

### Tracking stops automatically

If a tacker does not find the selected feature in the next frame, the tracking process stops. If more than 90 frames have already been tracked, a window appears to select the minimum and maximum value in which the reason for the abort is displayed with e.g. `Info: Tracker Woman Lost`.

If less than 90 frames have been processed, a message box should pop up with the message `Tracking time insufficient`. In this case, no output is generated because there is not enough data for the algorithm to work with.

### Tracking stops very often

The selection of the tracking feature is tricky and requires some practice and experience. For a good tracking result, unique features in the video should be selected near the desired tacking position.

## Troubleshot for old installation method

If you have problems with the OFS integration setup first test if the app work in standalone mode by starting the `funscript-editor.exe`. This allows the source of the error to be narrowed down more quickly!

If the standalone application works, look for your problem in the issues listed below. If the standalone application not work or your issue was not solved by a point listed below, open an issue with a detailed problem description and the full terminal window output if available.

### Noting happens when i press the Shortcut for the Funscript Generator

In most cases, the variable `Settings.FunscriptGenerator` in the `funscript_generator.lua` script was not set correctly.

**Important:** You have to use use `/` or `\\` for the `\` symbols in your path!

### When press shortcut the message "C:\\Users\\...‚Äù is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file appears in the terminal output.

The path you have set in `Settings.FunscriptGenerator` does not exist. You have an typo in the path or forget an parent directory. Double check the complete path string!

### After setting the min and max value after tracking no points are inserted in OFS

If the points are missing in OFS then most likely the variable `Settings.TmpFile` in the `funscript_generator.lua` script is set incorrectly or the generator crashes. A crash could happen if your PC does not have enough memory. The amount of memory required depends heavily on the video resolution!

### The standalone application `funscript-editor.exe` show only a black console window

On slow hardware the application requires several seconds to load. Therefore wait at least 60 seconds when the black console window opens!
