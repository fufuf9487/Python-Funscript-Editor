# Python Funscript Editor

A Python program that use Computer Vision to predict the funscript actions. Most of you are probably interested in the [Open Funscripter (OFS)](https://github.com/OpenFunscripter/OFS) integration of this tool. I create a hacky lua script to integrate the prediction of this tool in OFS. More information in [OFS Integration](user-guide/ofs-integration/index.html). For the configuration see [this](user-guide/config/index.html) Documentation page.

**NOTE:** The Tool could also use as an standalone application with an build in UI. Due to the limitations it is not intended for productive use.
