# Python Funscript Editor

A Python program that use Computer Vision to predict the funscript actions. Most of you are probably interested in the [Open Funscripter (OFS)](https://github.com/OpenFunscripter/OFS) integration of this tool. I create a hacky lua script to integrate the prediction of this tool in OFS. More information and installation instructions in [OFS Integration](https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/Python-Funscript-Editor/blob/main/docs/app/docs/user-guide/ofs-integration.md). For the application configuration see [this](https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/Python-Funscript-Editor/blob/main/docs/app/docs/user-guide/config.md) Documentation page.

**NOTE:** The Tool could also use as an standalone application with an build in UI. Due to the limitations it is not intended for productive use.

## Documentation

The application documentation is located in [`./docs/app/docs`](https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/Python-Funscript-Editor/blob/main/docs/app/docs)
