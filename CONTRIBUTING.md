# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Currently i donâ€™t have project specific contribution instructions. But as long as the code is clean and the function is useful for the project, I will be very willing to merge your pull requests. Please note that it can take several days until I notice your pull request, because I don't have any notifications from GitHub set up for this account.
